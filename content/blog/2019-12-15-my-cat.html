<p>My cat’s name is Chunk, and I adopted him from the humane society two and a half years ago. He is a fat (14.5 lb) Siamese cat and is the most loving boy in the whole world. Not to brag, but many people who previously hated cats have met Chunk and fallen in love. He loves belly rubs and will sit on anyone’s lap if there is a blanket on it. He will actively search for people who are sleeping so he can sleep with them. I have also uploaded some pictures of him :)
