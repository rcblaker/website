In addition to working in R studio this year, we've been learning how to work with Python! This is my first time ever learning Python coding, and it's definitely more of a challenge for me. Who would've guessed I'd be missing R so much! Heres some code from one of the first assignments I've completed in Python :) 
```{python}
##using re.findall()
```
